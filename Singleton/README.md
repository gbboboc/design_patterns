This example illustrates the structure of the `Singleton` design pattern and focuses on the following questions:

* What classes does it consist of?

* What roles do these classes play?

* In what way the elements of the pattern are related?

 ### What is the Singleton Pattern?
 
 The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is used to prevent multiple instances of the same class from being created, ensuring consistency throughout the application. 

* It restricts the instantiation of a class to only one object.

* A global access point is provided to get that instance.

* It is often used in other design patterns like Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype.

* Common use cases include logging, drivers, caching, and thread pools.

 #### When to use the Singleton Pattern?

* When you need exactly one instance of a class and want to control its global access.

* If the sole instance needs to be extensible by subclassing and clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying the existing code.

* In scenarios where resource management, such as database connections or configuration settings, needs centralized handling.

#### Identification: 

* Singleton can be recognized by a static creation method, which returns the same cached object.

 #### Pros

* You can be sure that a class has only a single instance.

* You gain a global access point to that instance.

* The singleton object is initialized only when it’s requested for the first time.

 #### Cons

 * Violates the `Single Responsibility Principle.` The pattern solves two problems at the time.

 * The Singleton pattern can mask bad design, for instance, when the components of the program know too much about each other.

 * The pattern requires special treatment in a multithreaded environment so that multiple threads won’t create a singleton object several times.

 * It may be difficult to unit test the client code of the Singleton because many test frameworks rely on inheritance when producing mock objects. Since the constructor of the singleton class is private and overriding static methods is impossible in most languages, you will need to think of a creative way to mock the singleton. Or just don’t write the tests. Or don’t use the Singleton pattern.
