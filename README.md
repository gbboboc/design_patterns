# Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

**These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.**

1. [Factory Pattern](https://github.com/DeGambino/design_patterns/tree/main/Factory) 

2. [Prototype Pattern](https://github.com/DeGambino/design_patterns/tree/main/Prototype) 

3. [Singleton Pattern](https://github.com/DeGambino/design_patterns/tree/main/Singleton)

4. [Builder Pattern](https://github.com/gbboboc/design_patterns/tree/main/Builder)
   

### Structural Patterns

**These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.**
1. [Adapter Pattern](https://github.com/gbboboc/design_patterns/tree/main/Adapter)

2. [Facade Pattern](https://github.com/gbboboc/design_patterns/tree/main/Facade)

3. [Flyweight Pattern](https://github.com/gbboboc/design_patterns/tree/main/Flyweight)

4. [Proxy Pattern](https://github.com/gbboboc/design_patterns/tree/main/Proxy)



### Behavioral Patterns

**These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.**

1. [Command Pattern](https://github.com/DeGambino/design_patterns/tree/main/Command)

2. [Mediator Pattern](https://github.com/gbboboc/design_patterns/tree/main/Mediator)

3. [Observer Pattern](https://github.com/DeGambino/design_patterns/tree/main/Observer)

4. [Iterator Pattern](https://github.com/gbboboc/design_patterns/tree/main/Iterator)

5. [Strategy Pattern](https://github.com/gbboboc/design_patterns/tree/main/Strategy)
