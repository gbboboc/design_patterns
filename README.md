2. [Prototype Pattern](https://github.com/DeGambino/design_patterns/tree/main/Prototype) 

3. [Singleton Pattern](https://github.com/DeGambino/design_patterns/tree/main/Singleton) 

### Structural Patterns

**These patterns deal with object composition, focusing on how classes and objects can be composed to form larger structures.**

1. [Flyweight Pattern](https://github.com/DeGambino/design_patterns/tree/main/Flyweight)

2. [Mixin Pattern](https://github.com/DeGambino/design_patterns/tree/main/Mixin)

4. [Proxy Pattern](https://github.com/DeGambino/design_patterns/tree/main/Proxy)

5. [Static Import](https://github.com/DeGambino/design_patterns/tree/main/StaticImport)

### Behavioral Patterns

**These patterns are concerned with communication between objects, defining how they interact and behave.**

1. [Command Pattern](https://github.com/DeGambino/design_patterns/tree/main/Command)

2. [Mediator/Middleware Pattern](https://github.com/DeGambino/design_patterns/tree/main/MediatorMiddleware)
