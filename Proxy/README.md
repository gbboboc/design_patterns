This example illustrates the structure of the `Proxy` design pattern and focuses on the following questions:

* What classes does it consist of?

* What roles do these classes play?

* In what way the elements of the pattern are related?

### What is the Proxy Pattern?

The Proxy pattern provides an intermediary object that controls access to another object. This can be used to add functionality such as validation, logging, or lazy initialization, without modifying the original object. 

* The Proxy object intercepts operations on the target object, such as getting or setting properties.

* The `get` and `set` methods are commonly overridden to manage property access and mutation.

* `Reflect` is a built-in object often used in Proxy implementations to delegate operations back to the original target object.

* Common use cases include input validation, logging, lazy loading, or access control.

 #### When to use the Proxy Pattern?

* When you need to control or validate access to an object’s properties.

* When you want to transparently introduce additional behavior, such as logging or input validation, without modifying the original object.

* In scenarios where resource-heavy objects need to be initialized only when necessary (lazy initialization).

#### Identification: 

* Proxies delegate all of the real work to some other object. Each proxy method should, in the end, refer to a service object unless the proxy is a subclass of a service.

#### Pros

* You can control the service object without clients knowing about it.

* You can manage the lifecycle of the service object when clients don’t care about it.

* The proxy works even if the service object isn’t ready or is not available.

* `Open/Closed Principle.` You can introduce new proxies without changing the service or clients.

#### Cons

* The code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot of new classes.

* The response from the service might get delayed.
